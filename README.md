LEDcandle
=========

This is the firmware and the CAD files for a small LED Candle or LED Fire Modul, based on a AVR ATtiny microcontroller.
The LED Candle imitates the flickering of a real candle. You could use the module also for a fire in a dollhouse or for model trains.
The firmware is written in C for the avr-gcc compiler, by using WinAVR or the AVR Studio.

Features:
* 8 Pins for LEDflickering
* 8 Pins to enable every LED
* Open Source Firmware
* Hardware as Target PCB design
* On-board ISP header for upgrading firmware
